# TuneSurf

## Description

The motivation to create TuneSurf, was to have all the things we like from our favorite artists in a same space. Currently, you need to use different apps/social media platforms to see different type of content of your favorite music acts. If you want to listen to your favorite songs you need to enter any of the different music apps/platforms (Spotify, Apple Music, Youtube, etc.), if you want to see content related you need to use any of the content related apps/platforms (Pinterest, Tumblr, Instagram, etc.) and finally if you want to search for events near to you need to use a third-party website (Ticketmaster, Superboletos, Vivid Events, etc.). With TuneSurf, you will get the benefit of having these three things (music, content and events) in the the same website, without having to switch between the different apps, offering an user-friendly app that can be used by anyone.
