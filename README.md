# TuneSurf

## Description

The motivation to create TuneSurf, was to have all the things we like from our favorite artists in a same space. Currently, you need to use different apps/social media platforms to see different type of content of your favorite music acts. If you want to listen to your favorite songs you need to enter any of the different music apps/platforms (Spotify, Apple Music, Youtube, etc.), if you want to see content related you need to use any of the content related apps/platforms (Pinterest, Tumblr, Instagram, etc.) and finally if you want to search for events near to you need to use a third-party website (Ticketmaster, Superboletos, Vivid Events, etc.). With TuneSurf, you will get the benefit of having these three things (music, content and events) in the the same website, without having to switch between the different apps, offering an user-friendly app that can be used by anyone.

Through the process of developing TuneSurf we combined the skills we have learned in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This include the use of third-party APIs, CSS frameworks, to develop our website.

## Usage

TuneSurf is a very easy app to use, however we understand not everything comes naturally, so here is the step by step:

1. Go to https://rodrigorol.github.io/TuneSurf/index.html, this is TuneSurf main page.
2. You will see a search bar that says "Type Here!", here you will search your favorite artist/band.
3. If you have used our app before, in the bottom of the main page you will see a section called "Your previous searches!", in this section you will find easy access to your previous searches, clicking on the artist you want to search again, without needing to type it again.
4. Click the "Go!" and you will be redirected to a page where you will see the content of your artist, song and albums and events near to you (currently supporting only Mexico).
5. Enjoy your favorite artists! 

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
